# systems
This repo contains some code I wrote for my systems class at Harvard. the goal of most of this code is to complete "weensey OS" and i have written memory segmentation and management systems from scratch, an entire kernel, process management, cache, etc. 
The "assembly" folder contains a puzzle we were given. A whole bunch of assembly that I spent a week deep in using gdb and had to figure out a code to "defuse" the puzzle.
